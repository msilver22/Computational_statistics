# Computational statistics examples
---
In this repository we present some statistical applications. 

## 1- [Model selection in GLM with logistic regression](https://github.com/msilver22/Computational_statistics/tree/main/GLM_model_selection)

We use AIC and BIC with generated data. Here the [Report](https://github.com/msilver22/Computational_statistics/blob/main/GLM_model_selection/A-report.pdf) with the problem and the results.

## 2- [High dimensional model selection](https://github.com/msilver22/Computational_statistics/tree/3a7ca39b8d0e40db5a163d2e20fa2110b5633dd7/High_model_selection)

We use Iterative Soft-thresholding and LARS with generated data. Here the [Report](https://github.com/msilver22/Computational_statistics/blob/779fe63123c27e59725a00ba5ad386b95c34d12b/High_model_selection/2report.pdf) with the problem and the results.

## 3- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/msilver22/Computational_statistics/tree/9b471ae039e0eb45c2254c25f6bc32da1f54ca54/Bootstrap)
